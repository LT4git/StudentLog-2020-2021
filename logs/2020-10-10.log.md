- [ ] Finish Puzzle 2 - Started
- [X] Create Rooms for Puzzle 3

Signing off. I ran into a problem for Puzzle 2, but other than that I am finished with that puzzle, apart from comments and ASCII Art. I created all the rooms for Puzzle 3 and started working on it. Please note I took a few breaks, but most of this time was me working!

- [X] Fix Problem with Puzzle 2

Signing off. I was able to fix my problem from puzzle 2. It also applies to puzzle 3, so that was really important. I am almost done with puzzle 3; I just have to finish the endings. I am almost done with this project, but, right now, I am super tired.
